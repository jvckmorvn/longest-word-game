## Introduction
Welcome to this fun little word game, based on a similar one found on Channel 4's 'Countdown' game show. Here's how it works: at the beginning of each game, you are presented with 10 random letters. You must then submit the longest valid English word you can construct from these letters. The longer the word, and the faster your submit it, the higher your score. Bonne chance!

## Ruby versions
